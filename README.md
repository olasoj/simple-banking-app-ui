## Features

**The following functionalities are available in this application:**

- Users can request their account balance by entering their account number and account password. Provided the account exists.

- Users can deposit any amount less than $1,000,000.00 to any account number, and the funds will be credited to the account in real-time. This is subject to the following constraints: The amount is between $1000,000.00 and $1.00, and the account exists.

- Users can request transaction history.

- Users can withdraw if the account balance after deducting the withdrawn amount from the current balance is at least $500, the withdrawal amount is larger than $1.00, and the account exists.

- Users can create an account and receive a unique 10-digit account number after signing up. When registering, the user must provide an account name that does not already exist on the platform, as well as a minimum deposit of $500.00.

- The account number and password are used to authenticate the user, which results in the user receiving an access token if successful.

- Except for login and registration, every request must have a valid access token.

- This system was built using the spring-boot framework with spring security, without a database, and following the best principles in software engineering.
